## Description

The personal minisite serves as a template, allowing one to setup a small site about themself on the internet with minimal configuration. It features a small scrolling marquee (thanks to [this post](https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/css-marquee/)) of skills and technologies and a place for a few links to other profiles. It is written with pure HTML and CSS for speed and simplicity. Additionally, it can be hosted for free on any cloud provider's servers.
