Ever since taking the Linux red pill and ridding my daily setup of Windows, I've been searching for the ideal configuration for my workflow. Due to the immensity of options you have when you install Linux, it can be overwhelming to choose a distro, terminal, file manager, browser, UI toolkit, text editor, etc.... Over time, I've settled on running Arch Linux in tandem with the [Hyprland](https://hypr.land) Wayland compositor. It's allowed simple customization, while retaining speed and aesthetically pleasing animations and decorations. See the link below for the dotfiles.
