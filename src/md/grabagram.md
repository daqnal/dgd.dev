## Description

Distracted by endless doomscrolling, we've all been there before, and its promise of entertainment effectively wastes our time and turns our brains to mush. Keeping the app deleted helps to avoid the temptation, but what if you want to see some reels that your friend sent you? Grabagram is a program to solve this dilemma. It periodically pulls all the reels that were sent to you from Instagram, allowing you to watch and save them without going on the app. You can set how often you would like to receive your reels, with a minimum of daily.

Escape the rot; get back into real life.
