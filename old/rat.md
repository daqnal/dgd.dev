## Description

The horizontally spinning rat is an internet meme entailing exactly what it advertises: a video of a 3D rat spinning horizontally with accompanying music.
Seeing this trend while I was still learning web development, I attempted to recreate the video as a live website using raw HTML and CSS, as I didn't know JavaScript at the time.
The result was finicky, but it did work.
Since learning JS and React, I decided to recreate my old project with a 3D model and customization features.
